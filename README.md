# Profile Card with Random User API

This project is a **React Vite** application that displays a user profile fetched from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/). The profile is showcased in a responsive card layout with hover effects, styled using **Tailwind CSS**.

---

## Features

- **Dynamic Data**: Fetches user data from the API.
- **Interactive UI**: Displays user information with hover effects.
- **Responsive Design**: Tailored for various screen sizes using Tailwind CSS.
- **Skeleton Loader**: Displays a loading animation while fetching data.
- **Modern Build System**: Built with Vite for fast development and optimized builds.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up Tailwind CSS:
   If Tailwind CSS is not already configured, initialize it:
   ```bash
   npx tailwindcss init
   ```
   Then update your `tailwind.config.js` and CSS files as per the [Tailwind CSS installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

---

## How It Works

1. The app fetches data from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/api/?page=1&results=1&seed=abc) when the `ProfileCard` component mounts.
2. While fetching data, a skeleton loader provides visual feedback.
3. After fetching, user details such as name, email, phone, and location are displayed.
4. The card layout includes a hover effect to reveal additional information about the user.
